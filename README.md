# Windows Sleep Network Fix

**Automatically reconnect WiFi and Ethernet after Windows sleep/wake cycles**

## 🚨 The Problem

Does your Windows computer lose network connectivity after waking from sleep? You're not alone! This is an extremely common issue affecting:

- ✅ Windows 10 & 11 systems
- ✅ Both WiFi and Ethernet connections  
- ✅ Desktop PCs, laptops, and mini PCs
- ✅ Various network adapter brands
- ✅ Both battery and AC power modes

**Typical symptoms:**
- Network shows as "connected" but no internet access
- Need to manually disconnect/reconnect WiFi multiple times daily
- Ethernet requires unplugging/replugging cable
- Network troubleshooter temporarily fixes it
- Issue returns after every sleep cycle

## 💡 The Solution

This repository provides a **one-click automated solution** that:

- 🔄 **Automatically reconnects** network adapters when your system wakes
- 📋 **Runs on system startup** and wake events via Windows Task Scheduler
- 🔧 **Releases and renews IP** configurations to reset connections
- 📶 **Reconnects to saved WiFi** networks intelligently
- 🌐 **Restarts network adapters** to ensure clean connections
- 📝 **Logs all activity** for troubleshooting
- ⚡ **Zero maintenance** - set it and forget it

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Method 1: Batch Script (Recommended)
1. **Download** both `SetupAutoReconnect.bat` and `SetupAutoReconnect.ps1`
2. **Right-click** `SetupAutoReconnect.bat` → **"Run as administrator"**
3. **Done!** Your network will auto-reconnect after every wake cycle

### Method 2: PowerShell Script (Alternative)
1. **Download** `SetupAutoReconnect.ps1`
2. **Right-click** → "Run with PowerShell" **as Administrator**
3. **Done!** Your network will auto-reconnect after every wake cycle

### 🔄 Upgrading from v1.0?
**No problem!** Just run the v2.0 installer - it will:
- ✅ Automatically detect your existing installation
- ✅ Upgrade all components with enhanced features
- ✅ Preserve your existing logs (with backup)
- ✅ Replace the scheduled task with improved settings
- ✅ Show you exactly what was upgraded

## 🛠️ What It Does

The setup script automatically:
- ✅ Creates an intelligent PowerShell script that handles network reconnection
- ✅ Sets up a Windows scheduled task to run on wake/startup/logon
- ✅ Provides a manual test script for immediate troubleshooting
- ✅ Creates detailed logs with automatic rotation for monitoring
- ✅ Tests connectivity before attempting reconnection (avoids unnecessary resets)
- ✅ Handles both Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections intelligently
- ✅ Includes comprehensive error handling and recovery

## 📁 Files Created

- `C:\NetworkReconnect\NetworkReconnect.ps1` - Main reconnection script (enhanced v2.0)
- `C:\NetworkReconnect\RunManually.bat` - Manual testing tool with better UI
- `C:\NetworkReconnect\log.txt` - Activity logs with automatic rotation
- Windows Task: `NetworkReconnectOnWake` - Auto-execution with improved triggers

## 🔧 Testing & Verification

### Manual Testing
Test the fix before your next sleep cycle:
```batch
C:\NetworkReconnect\RunManually.bat
```

### Check Logs
Monitor what's happening:
```batch
notepad C:\NetworkReconnect\log.txt
```

### Verify Scheduled Task
Check if the task was created successfully:
```cmd
schtasks /query /tn NetworkReconnectOnWake
```

## 🗑️ Easy Uninstall

### Method 1: Batch Uninstaller (Recommended)
1. **Download** `Uninstall.bat`
2. **Right-click** → **"Run as administrator"**
3. **Done!** Everything is removed cleanly

### Method 2: Manual Removal
Remove the scheduled task:
```cmd
schtasks /delete /tn NetworkReconnectOnWake /f
```
Delete the folder: `C:\NetworkReconnect\`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### PowerShell Execution Policy Issues
If you get "execution policy" errors:

**Option 1: Use the Batch Script (Recommended)**
- The `SetupAutoReconnect.bat` automatically bypasses execution policy restrictions

**Option 2: Temporarily Allow Scripts**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

**Option 3: Run with Bypass**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File SetupAutoReconnect.ps1
```

### Script Not Working?
1. **Check the logs**: `C:\NetworkReconnect\log.txt`
2. **Verify task exists**: Run `schtasks /query /tn NetworkReconnectOnWake`
3. **Test manually**: Run `C:\NetworkReconnect\RunManually.bat`
4. **Check Windows Event Viewer** for Task Scheduler errors

### Still Having Issues?
Try these additional manual fixes:
- ✅ Disable "Allow computer to turn off this device" in Device Manager
- ✅ Set WiFi adapter to "Maximum Performance" in Power Options  
- ✅ Disable "Energy Efficient Ethernet" in adapter properties
- ✅ Update network drivers from manufacturer
- ✅ Disable "Fast Startup" in Power Options
- ✅ Run Windows Network Troubleshooter
